# SQL Reference Codes for Data Queries

This document provides some reference codes using general SQL syntax for data queries. The codes provided in this document are written in PostgreSQL, with pgAdmin being the graphical user interface for performing queries and connecting to PostgreSQL databases. The skills relevant to PostgreSQL are also applicable to any other major SQL database, such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, Oracle and much more. The sample databases used for this document are ‘dvdrental’ (database of a dvd rental shop) and ‘exercises’ (database of a facilities management site).
